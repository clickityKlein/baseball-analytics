    "\n",
    "## 2. Methods and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the exploring the data, the first main concern was the null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of null values were associated with `RankSeason` and `RankPlayoffs`. The values came if a team failed to make the playoffs. We decided to turn both of these columns in booleans, either a team made the playoffs or not and either a team won the World Series or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next set of null values came from `OOBP` and `OSLG`. These statistics simply weren't tracked prior to the 1999 season. To proceed we had the option of dropping the columns and using the entirety of the data or dropping the rows associated with seasons prior to 1999 and using a reduced dataset with more features. Ultimately, we went with both options as this offered a chance to test if `OOBP` and `OSLG` had a significant effect on different response variables while simultaneously allowing us to explore differences between models created with historic data (colloquially coined *full* in the analysis) and recent data (colloquially coined *recent* in the analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our last step in making the data amenable was to combine wins (`W`) with games (`G`) into winning percentage (`WP`), and runs scored with runs allowed to create run differential (`RD`). The individual columns were dropped after this to prevent collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We used logistic regression, a form of generalized linear modeling, to create models to predict playoffs and championship across historic and recent data. We created visuals for each feature against either playoffs or championship to evaluate if there was any pattern, or strong break, between the value of the feature and the outcome of either playoffs or championship. To select the best model, we used AIC, MSPE, chi-squared tests, and partial f-tests. To evaluate the best model, we used contingency tables (and accuracy) and predicted vs. observed plots. Each model had AIC and MSPE created through backwards selection using p-values from individual t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine predictors significant for the response variables `WP`, `OBP`, and `SLG`, we used multiple linear regression. We used forward selection, deciding the best fit for each size model with SSE for each of the response variables across historic and recent datasets. We created visuals for each feature against each of the response variables to visualize any strong linear correlations, and then used a combination of AIC, BIC, MSPE, $R^2_a$, partial f-tests, and full f-tests for model selection. For each best model, we used diagnostic plots to confirm the assumptions required for linear regression. All assumptions available to confirm by those plots were confirmed for all models. The last assumption we tested for was collinearity by using VIF. Although we used a litany of methods for selection, two of our models showed sign of collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to confirm the **Pythagorean Theorem of Baseball**, we transformed the theorem into a form we could use simple linear regression with, also applying some log-transformations with our data prior to building the model. We confirmed a factor for the formula that was in our expected range. The factor also had an acceptable p-value in the t-test showing significance. Using diagnostic plots, we confirmed the model itself met the assumptions for linear regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the **Pythagorean Theorem of Baseball**, we tested the historic and recent datasets along with our models. For the generalized linear models, the model predicting champions was very similar between the subsets. Playoffs had different models, but the best model using the recent dataset did not consist of the features only available in that dataset. For the multiple linear regression, the models differed significantly across the datasets and some of the models used features only available in the recent dataset. Overall, there was evidence suggesting that either timeframe or new features could affect the model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed an in-depth analysis testing multiple predictors across different parameters, and created decent models confirmed both visually and statistically. Although we didn't have the amount of data to perform analyses such as those referenced in Moneyball, even this amount of data can help us glimpse the coveted patterns Sabermetrics was founded on. We could have taken this research further by examining more subsets of years to gain a better understanding of how the data and the game was changing over time. Perhaps modeling by each decade would reveal more information. Furthermore, a more useful analysis would be attempting to model future performance based on a team's past performance. Or, if the data was available, attempt to predict how a team finishes a season given data at points through the season."
